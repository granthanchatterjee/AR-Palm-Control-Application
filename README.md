**'AR Palm Control'** is an application which gives you the ability to control your device's cursor with your hand provided:
   Your camera that is connected to the device you are using and working fine
   **AR Palm Control Application** is given access to use the camera
    
After opening the **AR Palm Control Application**, a window with set of instructions and a start button below the instructions will be present. 
Click the start button.
Wait for sometimes, and then your camera would start and a camera interface would open.
Now, show your hand to the camera so that the application can recognize your hand. Now, follow the instructions to control your cursor with your hand.
When you are done, click the close button below the camera interface so that you can close the program. It will also close the camera.
